room-title: "The Rooms"

room1-title: "Killer escape"
room1-copy: "Your team has been tipped off about the location of a serial killer's study, the door is unlocked and you sneak in. You look behind and the door quickly swings shut. You hear a locking noise and from a speaker somewhere you hear: ‘Intruder alert! Intruder alert! Self-destruct sequence has been activated! 1 Hour until self-destruct!’ Find out where the next victim is being held and find a way to escape before the bomb goes off."

room2-title: "No where to go"
room2-copy: "You awake in a basement, it is dark and it is cold. The smell of rot smacks you across the face and sends you reeling. You try to get up and stumble, realising that your hands are tied. There are others. Others locked in the same room as you. Others locked in the room next door. You have no idea how you got here but you do know one thing. This isn't a safe place. Work together as a team to escape before the person who put you here returns."

# FAQ section

faq-title: "Frequently Asked Questions"

faq:
- question: "I dont have a team of 6, can I still play?"
  answer: "Of course you can! But we do recommend 4 to 6 players, as our puzzles have been designed to be quite challenging. Besides, we charge a fixed price per room, so the more people the cheaper!"

- question: "Am I really locked inside the room?"
  answer: "The front door that you enter from will always be unlocked. This is because if anyone feels uncomfortable during the session, they always have the option to opt out. Unfortunately, the person that comes out cannot enter the room again and will not count as a success escape. Others in the room can still continue on with their mission."

- question: "Will there be anyone scaring us?"
  answer: "Don’t worry! There will be no one popping out from anywhere to scare you."

We are big fans of escape games and have played heaps of venues all around the world in our travel. We were bummed out that our home town awesome Radelaide doesn't have a single escape game venue. So we decided to create one."
